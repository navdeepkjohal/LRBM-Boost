**Introduction**

This is the implementation of the *Non-parametric Learning of Lifted Restricted Boltzmann Machines* (LRBM-Boost) paper which is available at [this link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X19302749).

*LRBM-Boost* is first learning algorithm for learning the structure and the parameters of lifted Restricted Boltzmann Machines(RBM) from data. Motivated by the success of functional gradient-boosting, this method learns a set of Relational Regression Trees using boosting and then transforms them to a lifted RBM.

This code builds upon the popular Boost-SRL tool available here [this link](https://github.com/starling-lab/BoostSRL) and the detailed documentaion is available [here](https://starling-lab.github.io/software/boostsrl/) and the type of input needed to run LRBM-Boost is identical to one required for running Boost-SRL tool.

**Software Requirement**

**Prerequisites**:

Java (tested with openjdk 1.8.0_144)
